This program is a simple image editor that draws using simple geometrical shapes.
IMPORTANT: OpenCV must be installed.

"main.cpp" also contains the code that calculates average time it takes to draw benchmark images without displaying them.

Code that draws pictures is present in "main.cpp" and in files "code_cat_rgb.txt" and "code_smiley_bw.txt".
